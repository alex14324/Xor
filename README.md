# XOR Malware Development

Welcome to the XOR Malware Development repository. This project provides educational resources and examples for understanding XOR encryption techniques used in malware development. XOR is a common encryption method employed by malware developers to obfuscate their payloads, making it harder for security systems to detect and analyze malicious code.

## Overview

XOR (exclusive OR) encryption is a simple yet effective method for obfuscating data. In malware development, XOR is often used to encrypt payloads or data to evade detection by security tools. The encrypted data is then decrypted at runtime, allowing the malware to execute its payload while remaining hidden from static analysis.

This repository covers:

- **Basic XOR Encryption**: Understanding how XOR encryption works and how it is applied in malware.
- **XOR Obfuscation Techniques**: Techniques to enhance XOR encryption and obfuscate payloads more effectively.
- **Sample Code**: Examples of XOR-based encryption and decryption used in malware.
